# Contributing to Monitorian

Thanks to your interest in contributing to this project.

## 1. Issues

Please take following steps to open an issue.

- Read through [Detection of external monitors](https://github.com/emoacht/Monitorian#detection-of-external-monitors) and [Reporting](https://github.com/emoacht/Monitorian#reporting) in readme.

- Search open and closed issues to date. To search both issues at once, remove `is:open` from default syntax and use only `is:issue` syntax.

- Include all information necessary for a reader who has no knowledge about your monitor or other devices to understand the issue. Include how to reproduce the issue as well.

- Add logs. A video clip is not so helpful because it will not have information on what is happening internally.

- Opening an issue alone will not mean you completed reporting. <ins>Be prepared to respond to a request after opening.</ins> In most cases, you will be requested to provide additional information.

An issue which does not include any meaningful clue will be closed on sight. It is because such person would hardly provide enough information even if asked to do so.
