The user can change the brightness of monitors, including external ones, either individually or in unison. For the system with an ambient light sensor, the adjusted brightness can be shown along with configured one.

## Add-on Features

Add-on features are available for Microsoft Store version on a subscription basis.

### Command-line options

You can use command-line options to get/set the brigtness.

| Actions                                | Options                                |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Get brightness of a monitor.           | /get                                   |
| Get brightness of a specified monitor. | /get [Device Instance ID]              |
| Get brightness of all monitors.        | /get all                               |
| Set brightness of a monitor.           | /set [Brightness]                      |
| Set brightness of a specified monitor. | /set [Device Instance ID] [Brightness] |
| Set brightness of all monitors.        | /set all [Brightness]                  |

The brightness ranges from 0 to 100%. It can be specified with brightness itself (e.g. 20), increase (e.g. +10) or decrease (e.g. -10). The device instance ID is an unique identifier given by the OS to each monitor.

You can call this app by its name `Monitorian` in command prompt or bat file. From Task Scheduler, it can be performed by the path to its alias `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps\Monitorian.exe`. For example, to increase brightness of all monitors by 30%, the Action will be the following:

The code for add-on features is not included in this repository.

## Development

This app is a WPF app developed and tested with Surface Pro 4.

### Probe

 - You can check the compatibility of your monitor by __probe.log__. It will include raw information on monitors, including capabilities through DDC/CI, from various APIs that are used to find accessible monitors. To get this log, tap `Probe into monitors` in the hidden menu described below.
 - To open the hidden menu, <ins>click app title at the top of menu window 3 times.</ins> 

### Rescan

 - As part of testing, you can manually trigger to rescan monitors via `Rescan monitors` in the hidden menu. A system sound will be played when completed.

### Operations

 - As part of testing, you can record operations to scan monitors and reflect their states. To enable the recording, check `Make operation log` in the hidden menu. After that, __operation.log__ can be copied by `Copy operation log`.

### Exceptions

 - If anything unexpected happens, __exception.log__ will be saved. It will be useful source of information when looking into an issue.

### Setup

1. [Install Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio).
2. In Visual Studio Installer, go to the **Individual components** tab and make sure the following components are checked and installed. The version must match the corresponding field of project (.csproj) file of each project.

| Components                                                      | Fields                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| .NET Framework 4.7.2 SDK<br>.NET Framework 4.7.2 targeting pack | TargetFrameworkVersion |
| Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041.0)                                   | TargetPlatformVersion  |

3. Load the solution by specifying `/Source/Monitorian.sln`. Then go to the solution explorer and right click the solution name and execute `Restore NuGet Packages`.

### Globalization

An alternative language can be shown by adding a Resources (.resx) file into `/Source/Monitorian.Core/Properties` folder. Each Resources file stores name/value pairs for a specific language and will be selected automatically depending on the user's environment.

 - The file name must be in `Resources.[language-culture].resx` format.
 - The name of a name/value pair must correspond to that in the default `Resources.resx` file to override it.

`Resources.ja-JP.resx` (for Japanese) would be a good example for this purpose.
