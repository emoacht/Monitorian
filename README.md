The user can change the brightness of monitors, including external ones, either individually or in unison. For the system with an ambient light sensor, the adjusted brightness can be shown along with configured one.

## Development

This app is a WPF app developed and tested with Surface Pro 4.

### Setup

The following information can be interpreted from `.csproj` files, but is included for convenience.

Dev Dependencies:
 - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

Once Visual Studio is installed, acquire the following if they were not installed by default.
This can be done via Visual Studio Installer. (Choose **more** -> **modify** -> **Individual components tab**)

 - .NET Framework 4.7.2 SDK
 - .NET Framework 4.7.2 target pack
 - Blend for Visual Studio SDK for .NET
 - Windows 10 SDK (choose one from `10.0.14393.0` to `10.0.17134.0`)
 
 
 Then boot up `/Source/Monitorian.sln` with Visual Studio, and click **&#9654; Start**. See if the build process completes without error. If so, congratulations! You can begin to develop new features.

### Log

The logs will be useful when looking into an issue.

 - __exception.log__ - Information on exceptions when an unexpected problem happened.

 - __probe.log__ - Information on capabilities of each monitor obtained from various APIs and used to find accessible monitors. To get this log, click the app title in menu window 3 times and then tap the button appeared beneath.

### Globalization

An alternative language can be shown by adding a Resources (.resx) file which stores name/value pairs under `/Source/Monitorian.Core/Properties` folder. The system will automatically select the file which matches the user's environment.

 - The file name must be in `Resources.[language-culture].resx` format.
 - The name of a name/value pair must correspond to that in the default `Resources.resx` file to override it.

`Resources.ja-JP.resx` (for Japanese) would be a good example for this purpose.
