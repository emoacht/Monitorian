## 1. General

## 2. Issues

- Check [Detection of external monitors](https://github.com/emoacht/Monitorian#detection-of-external-monitors) and [Reporting](https://github.com/emoacht/Monitorian#reporting).

- Search [Issues](https://github.com/emoacht/Monitorian/issues) to date. To search open and closed issues at once, remove `is:open` from default syntax in Filters box and use only `is:issue` syntax.

- Include all information necessary for a reader who has no knowledge about your monitor or other devices to understand and reproduce the issue.
